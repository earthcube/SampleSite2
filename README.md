# SampleSite2
Name: EarthCube Tool Workshop

Description: Simple description of your workshop.

Visuals: EarthCube logo, fairly plain (but accessible) theme.

Keys for re-use as template for other sites:
* All hyperlinks should be descriptive of what users will find by clicking on them. So in a statement like "click here to see the schedule for this event," rather than hyperlinking the words "click here," you'd want to hyperlink the words "schedule for this event," or perhaps the entire phrase.
* Title text in layout.md should be kept in white text in order to maintain proper visual contrast with background.
* All videos should be captioned (you can ask YouTube to do this automatically, with 80%+ fidelity). Ideally someone would be able to comb through and manually caption any embedded videos for added accuracy.
* The table on schedule.md should be accessible for users who use screen reader technologies. Maintain the "pipes and hyphens" formatting and it should read properly.
* As much as possible, relative URLs should be used for all intra-site linking. Using absolute URLs will end up directing users to this version of the site, but using relative URLs will make it easier and less-confusing to create a new site that directs to other resources and links related to that new site instead of this copied one.
